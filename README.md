# RobustnessTestTool


This project is open-source and lays the foundation for a comprehensive application designed to test the robustness of image segmentation algorithms. It is a unique framework allowing testing for any model, given that the model fulfills specific requirements which can be found here: https://www.synapse.org/Portal/filehandle?ownerId=syn18779624&ownerType=ENTITY&fileName=SubmissionInstructions.pdf&preview=false&wikiId=592666. The main objective is to assess the robustness against various interference effects accurately. For detailed insights and extensive information on the methodology and principles underlying this project, please refer to my Bachelor Thesis available here: https://github.com/KTV02/RobustnessTestTool/blob/main/BachelorarbeitLennartKremp.pdf

Requirements & Compatibility

    The Python interpreter used for the backend must be operative on a Linux system.
    If utilizing a Windows system, ensure the Python path is directed to a Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2), for instance, the Ubuntu subsystem on Windows.

Purpose & Contribution

The aspiration of this project is not only to serve as a foundational base but to act as a springboard for other developers. By leveraging this codebase, developers can extend the application into a fully-fledged testing utility capable of quantifying the robustness of image segmentation algorithms against a spectrum of interference effects accurately.

Contributors are encouraged to expand upon the functionalities, refine the existing features, and potentially uncover novel avenues to assess algorithm robustness, enhancing the overall utility and effectiveness of the application in real-world scenarios.
Getting Started

To begin with, make sure to fulfill the above-mentioned system requirements and review the model requirements specified in the Submission Instructions of the ROBUST-MIS Challenge linked above.
